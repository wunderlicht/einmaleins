Einmaleins, German for multiplication table.

It is a training sheet generator that produces an RTF file
with 20 randomly generated multiplication tasks.

The factors range from 1 to 10.

Running the executable generates `einmaleins.rtf` in the current
directory containing one A4 page with 20 multiplications.

Print the page and practice your Einmaleins.
